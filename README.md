# exchange_rate

- This is my little project to test working with ETL, API's and DB

# How does it work?

- I am using Free API from "https://v6.exchangerate-api.com" to download data about current rate of USD. After that there is a transformation process to use only needed data and in the right formate. It also inlcudes loading the data to database. Data from the dataabse is then accessed by GET from API.
